    <h1>THE ART OF CREATIVE THINKING</h1>
    <p><em>
        Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows asa
        Like harmony in music; there is a dark 
        Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles 
        Discordant elements, makes them cling together 
        In one society. 
    </em></p>
    <p>
        The importance of creative thinking today needs no emphasis. 
        In your profession or sphere of work you will have a competitive 
        advantage if you develop your ability to come up with new ideas. 
        In your personal life, too, creative thinking can lead you into 
        new paths of creative activity. It can enrich your life – though 
        not always in the way you expect.

    <h2>Use the stepping stones of analogy</h2>
    <p>
        Put yourself into the shoes of an inventor. 
        You have become dissatisfied with the solution 
        to some existing problem or daily necessity. 
        You are casting about in your mind for a new idea. 
        Something occurs to you, possibly suggested by reading 
        about other people’s attempts in the files of the patent office. You go home and sketch your invention, and then make a model of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are other later stages, of course, 
        but let us stop here. 
        The point is that the model you have reached may 
        well have been suggested by an analogy from nature. 
        Indeed you could look upon nature as a storehouse of 
        models waiting to be used by inventors.
